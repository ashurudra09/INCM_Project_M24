# Izhikevich Neuron Model for Pattern Recognition

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of the Izhikevich neuron model for pattern recognition/classification tasks. The project simulates biologically-inspired spiking neuron dynamics and applies them to real-world datasets (Iris and Penguins), showcasing both the neural simulation and its application as a classifier compared to traditional machine learning models.

## Features

- **Biologically-Inspired Neuron Simulation:**  
  Implements the Izhikevich neuron model, simulating spiking behavior and membrane dynamics for different neuron types (e.g., regular spiking, intrinsic bursting).

- **Data Preprocessing & Encoding:**  
  Converts standard datasets (Iris, Penguins) into current input signals suitable for neuron-based simulation.

- **Pattern Recognition:**  
  Trains single neurons to classify input patterns using biologically plausible mechanisms.

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Benchmarks the Izhikevich neuron-based classifier against traditional classifiers (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression) and visualizes results.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Provides Jupyter notebooks and scripts for exploring and visualizing input datasets.

## Ideas Used

- **Izhikevich Neuron Model:**  
  A computationally efficient spiking neuron model that can reproduce a wide variety of firing patterns observed in real biological neurons.

- **Pattern Encoding:**  
  Real-world tabular data is encoded into current input signals, which are then processed by the simulated neuron.

- **Single Neuron Classification:**  
  Demonstrates that even a single spiking neuron (with appropriate input encoding and training) can perform basic pattern recognition.

- **Comparison with Conventional ML:**  
  Provides a side-by-side evaluation of biologically-inspired and traditional classification approaches on standard datasets.

## Future Scope

- **Extend to Multi-Neuron Networks:**  
  Implement networks of Izhikevich neurons for more complex classification and time-series tasks.

- **Broader Dataset Support:**  
  Test with more challenging or larger datasets.

- **Advanced Training Algorithms:**  
  Explore STDP (Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity) and other biologically realistic learning rules.

- **Optimization & Performance:**  
  Parallelize simulation, leverage GPUs, or use optimized libraries for larger-scale experiments.

- **Visualization Improvements:**  
  Enhance visualization of spike trains, membrane potentials, and decision boundaries.
