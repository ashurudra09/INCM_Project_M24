# INCM Project M24: 
## Project Title: Izhikevich Neuron Model for Pattern Recognition

## Part 1: Simulating the Neuron Model

- Check [This Notebook](Code/izhikevich_neuron_model.ipynb) for more details of how to simulate the neuron model.

## Part 2: Converting Data into current input signals

- **Note:** Datasets used:
  - Iris flower dataset (borrowed from [here](https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7))
  - Penguins dataset (borrowed from [here](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/penguins.csv))

- For data visualization, look at [this notebook](Code/data_viz.ipynb).

## Part 3: Training the Neuron Model

## Part 4: Results and Comparative Analysis
